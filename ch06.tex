\section{Debugging}
If you've been writing perfect Matlab code up to this point... congratulations.
 But eventually you're likely to encounter a bug in you code.
 The graphical nature of the editor, and the interpreted nature of the code allows for easy debugging.pul

\subsection{Breakpoints}
You can enable a breakpoint by clicking on the small dash next to your code.
 This puts a red circle next to that line.
 The next time your code runs, it will stop right before executing that line.

\begin{quote}
\verbatiminput{code/TODO.m}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Stepping}
You can then use the step and continue commands to move through your code, investigating variable values as you go.

\begin{quote}
 \verbatiminput{code/TODO.m}
\end{quote}
