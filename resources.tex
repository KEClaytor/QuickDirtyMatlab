As you've now seen, this is only the roughest introduction to the Fortran language.
 You'll likely need more material to supplement your learning, and for more of the subtltly that could not be expressed here.
 These references are the ones that I've used in compiling this \emph{Guide} and would highly recommend reviewing them all if you have time.

\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{Modern Fortran in Practice} by Arjen Markus
 is an excellent text on Fortran 2008, and was largely used as reference.
 \item \url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fortran}
 The wiki fortran book. Is good and concise.
 \item \url{http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs201/NOTES/fortran.html}
 Course notes for Fortran 90, but still very applicable, and that point out some of the subtlties I could only gloss over.
\end{itemize}
