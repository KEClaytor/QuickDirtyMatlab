As you've now seen, this is only the roughest introduction to the Matlab.
 You'll likely need more material to supplement your learning, and for more of the subtltly that could not be expressed here.
 These are the resouces I most frequently visit when using Matlab and those that I recall using when learning matlab.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Simply type in ''help command'' to get a quick description of that function / command
 \item Likewise ''doc command'' will bring up the the command in the help browser, often with example images and code.
 \item (TODO: href) Matlab Answers and the (TODO: href) Matlab File Exchange are fantastic resources as well.
\end{itemize}
