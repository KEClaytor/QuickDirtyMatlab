% Variables
%  You can use variables to save values you want to use later
%  You don't need to type-cast:
x = 5
y = 6.435134
X = 'this is a string'

% We can see their value by calling them
x
y
X

% Can be a mix of letters and numbers
%  but cannot start with a number
a1 = 1;
a2 = 2;
2a = 3; % not allowed!

% Complex numbers can use i or j
c = 1 + 3.2*i;
c2 = 1 - 3.2*j;

% We can substitute variables into equations to operate on their value
x + y
a1*a2*a2
% complex math also works
c + c2
c*c2
c/c2

% There are some mathematical constants built in.
%  it would be wise to name your variables something else
pi
e
i
