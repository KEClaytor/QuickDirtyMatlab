Unfortunately MATLAB really falls a bit short in input and output of files.
 Their GUI file importer has improved by leaps and bounds, however.
 We'll explore a couple of different ways for file IO below.

\subsection{File Read/Write}
We can use \verbatim{fopen}, \verbatim{fread}, and \verbatim{fprintf} for some basic file IO.

\begin{quote}
\verbatiminput{code/TODO.m}
\end{quote}

\subsection{GUI File Read}
Matlab can automate the reading of most simple delimited text files.
 You can then copy Matlab code to automate the read later.
 This can only really be demonstrated with screnshots;

\begin{quote}
 \verbatiminput{code/TODO.m}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Save and Load}
Matlab also has \verbatim{save} and \verbatim{load} commands that allow for direct saving of multiple Matlab variables and variable types.
 This is similar to Python's pickle module.

\begin{quote}
 \verbatiminput{code/TODO.m}
\end{quote}
