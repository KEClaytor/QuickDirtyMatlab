\section{Curve Fitting}

\subsection{Fit}
Matlab has several handy curve-fit models bulit in.
 These inclue polynominal and exponential fits.

\subsection{Custom Fit}
Quite often, you have your own model to fit to the data.
 You can use that for the fit, but we have to construct the model first.
 Once you have a model, we give the fitting routine bounds for the variables and initial guesses.

\subsection{Confidence Intervals}
Once you have your data fit, we can find out well the parameters are fit by using confidence intervals.
